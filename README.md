# LWC Metrics

LWC builds a simple graph of information from those who run it. While HTTP analysis tools such as awstats can help give basic usage stats, it can only give an idea to the scale of what is happening.

These metrics tools were made open source to improve user-feedback and to be 100% open as to what it stores. No IPs will ever be stored in a database. Instead, servers are identified by a plugin-generated GUID.
